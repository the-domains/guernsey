description: "Moonshine Sweet Tea started in 1946 out in the Texas Hill Country, in the small town of Mason, Texas, by Leo Cobb Porter: the great grand-dad of Joele Porter. Moonshine's style of bold sweet tea uses the same secret family recipe that Leo Cobb Porter perfected in his own home, almost 70 years ago."
